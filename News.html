      <h2 id="first">We hope you're having fun playing Bubble Shooter!</h2><br><br>
      <p>Now, we announce a new version of the game. <br>
      "Bubble Buzz" Brings the Classic Bubble Shooter Game to the Hands of Mobile Gamers. <br>
      The new "Bubble Buzz" title will put players' quick movements to the test along with 
      their bubble popping skills while offering chances to win real cash. <br>
      A game of focus and bubble elimination, "Bubble Buzz" stays true to the AviaGames portfolio,
       offering fair-matched, multiplayer tournaments with zero ads for an uninterrupted gaming experience. 
       we've improved gameplay and overall experience through bug fixes.</p><br>
      <h2> Playing "Bubble Buzz"</h2>
<p>A simple, fun and relaxing game, "Bubble Buzz" sets users out on the task to eliminate 
all the bubbles from the screen. Users simply move a finger to aim and let go of a bubble. <br>
 Hitting two bubbles of the same color will cause elimination and bubbles fall when they are 
 not connected to other bubbles. For every four bubbles fired, the interface will go to 
 the next line and the total number of lines will be displayed at the top right of the screen 
 until there are none â€“ and the game has been won. With the goal to hit the right spots that 
 cause the greatest number of bubbles to fall as quickly as possible, "Bubble Buzz" allows 
 players to kick up their gaming skills with acquired props and double bubble specials available.
  From "Bomb" to "Rocket," "Lightning Bubbles," and "Rainbow Bubbles," as users pop more bubbles,
   they will gain more points to leverage these various props. <br> Players can practice for free or
    securely deposit and withdraw cash winnings with PayPal, Apple Pay, Venmo, Visa, Mastercard, and American Express.</p><br>
